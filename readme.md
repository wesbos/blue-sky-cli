## 🟦☁️ BlueSky CLI

This was a little CLI app view your feed and post, now I'm just using it as my playground for the AT protocol API.

So far it:

1. Posts skeets
2. Gets timeline in CLI
3. Is a bot that replies to mentions and follows of the incorrect handle.

4. Make a `.env` file
5. Put your `BSKY_USERNAME` and `BSKY_USERNAME` in there.
6. run `npm run dev`

Kinda fun
